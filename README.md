# Zenit Tracker

**Precision in Every Test.**

Zenit Tracker is a professional Quality Assurance (QA) management application designed to streamline the manual testing process. It provides a centralized, robust platform for testers to import test cases, execute testing sessions across various platforms, track results in real-time, and export detailed, professionally formatted reports.

## What Problem Does It Solve?

Manual software testing can often be a disorganized process involving scattered spreadsheets, inconsistent reporting, and a lack of a centralized view of product quality. Zenit Tracker solves this by providing a structured and efficient workflow, ensuring that every test is tracked, every bug is documented, and every report is clear, consistent, and professional.
